      <p>Cherry blossom trees, also known as sakura in Japanese, are flowering trees famous for their beautiful and delicate pink or white blooms. They're most commonly associated with Japan, but they are also found in other parts of the world, including Korea, China, the U.S., and Europe.</p>

      <p>Cherry blossoms (Prunus species) are native to East Asia, particularly Japan, China, and Korea. Some wild species also grow in the Himalayas and parts of Russia. The cherry blossom has appeared in Chinese art and poetry since ancient times. In Chinese symbolism, it represents feminine beauty and strength, as well as love. In Japan between the 6-12th centuries the tradition of hanami (flower viewing) began. It has continued to be a tradition.</p>
